Calculations required for an in depth analysis on stock
1. Moving averages:
    - Trend that smooths out daily price fluctuations
        * This can allow us to calculate different averages (20 and 50 days) and
        by doing so we can figure uptrends and downtrends according to how the
        two averages intersect, to signal buy and sell alerts

2. Exponential moving averages (EMA):
    - Similar to moving averages but gives more weight to the recent prices
        * We pay more attentioin to how the stock is currently doing rather than
        how is went in the past

        * Formula -> EMA_t = a · Price_t + (1 - a) · EMA_(t-1)
        Where:
            -> EMA_t = EMA at the current time step
            -> a = 2 / (N + 1) -> smoothing factor where N is the span (# of periods)
            -> Price_t = Price at the current time step
            -> EMA_(t-1) = EMA at the previous time step

3. Daily Returns:
    - Calculate the change the price (in %) from previous days
        * Very general and simple metric to measure stock performance

        * Calculate percentage change on closing price between curr and prev row 

4. Volatility:
    - Check how stable the price of a stock is
        * We calculate this by getting the standard deviation of the daily returns
        over the last 20 days
        
        * Get the standard deviation of a rolling average

5. Volume indicators:
    - Simply keep track of the trading activity

6. Relative Strength Index (RSI):
    - Check if a stock is overbought or oversold 
        * compare the magnitude of the recent gains over the recent losses
        Think about it as a speedometer for the price momemtum

        * The calculation -> calculate the rolling average of gains and losses over
        a given period of time (e.g. 14 days).
        * Calculate the ratio of gains over losses
        * RSI = 100 - (100 / (1 + ratio))

7. Bollinger Bands
    - Measure the volatility and identify the potential overbought/oversold conditions
        * Middle Band = Moving average of closing price
        * Upper Band = Middle band + (2 * standard deviation)
        * Lower Band = Middle band - (2 * standard deviation)
